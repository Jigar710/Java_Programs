JVM task when we compile the program
	1 : it search for the .class files which we 
		already used in the main function
		in same folder
	2 : if JVM is not able to get the .class files
		then start searching for .java files with the
		same name in same folder
	3 : if JVM finds the .java file then JVM first 
		compile those files and creates the .class files
		in same folder.
	4 : nw user can access those .class files
-------------------------------------------------------------	
if wants automatic compilations of the java files
then we have to save file as a class name.
